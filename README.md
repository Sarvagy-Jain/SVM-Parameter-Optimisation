# SVM-Parameter-Optimisation

### About Project
Hyperparameter tuning or optimization is important in any machine learning model training activity. The hyperparameters of a model cannot be determined from the given datasets through the learning process.

### Dataset escription
This dataset was used in several classifications tasks related to the challenge of anuran species recognition through their calls. Each audio corresponds to one specimen (an individual frog), the record ID is also included as an extra column.

Dataset:- [Anuram Calls](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Anuran+Calls+%28MFCCs%29)
